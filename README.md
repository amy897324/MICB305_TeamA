# MICB305_TeamA
Introduction and Background: provides the premise for why/how your dataset was collected in addition to an overview of the studies that have already been conducted on your dataset or relevant to your dataset (consider what you presented for your P2 review oral presentation)

Hypothesis: How does the microbiome of patients as well as the different allergies they have impact the prevalence and severity of MS? We believe that there is a correlation between the microbiome, the MSS severity score, and the different categories of depression listed within the data. In the literature listed below, depression and MS share some biological causative factors (HPA axis for example which may have potential connections to the human microbiome). https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3181849/

Our dataset was collected from individuals around the world with the aim of finding a connection between MS and the microbiome, specifically how MS affects our microbiome. Participants were recruited via MS clinics around the world. Some studies which have already been conducted on our dataset include (), which focuses on eczema's role in masking the effects of MS on the microbiome as well as….(do we need to find/list them all?). Some studies conducted relevant to our dataset include () and (). Both focus on…

Potential ideas for experimental aim.

Separate microbiomes into groups, in R compare how depressions affect the microbiome.

Test between biodiversity and MSS severity (more or less diversity in different depressions)

Potentially run manova (whichever statistical test is for 3 or more variables).

Questions For Tomorrow:
What do we need to remove from the metadata?
Can you guide us to make a proposal in R after using QIIME2?
