Introduction and Background: provides the premise for why/how your dataset was collected in addition to an overview of the studies that have already been conducted on your dataset or relevant to your dataset (consider what you presented for your P2 review oral presentation)

Our dataset was collected from individuals around the world with the aim of finding a connection between MS and the microbiome, specifically how MS affects our microbiome. Participants were recruited via MS clinics around the world. Some studies which have already been conducted on our dataset include (), which focuses on eczema's role in masking the effects of MS on the microbiome as well as….(do we need to find/list them all?). Some studies conducted relevant to our dataset include () and (). Both focus on…


Potential ideas for experimental aim.

Separate microbiomes into groups, in R compare how depressions affect the microbiome.

Test between biodiversity and MSS severity (more or less diversity in different depressions)

Potentially run manova (whichever statistical test is for 3 or more variables).

Questions For Tomorrow
What do we need to remove from the metadata.
Can you guide us to make a proposal in R after using QIIME2.
