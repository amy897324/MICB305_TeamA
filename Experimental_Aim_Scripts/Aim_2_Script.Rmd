# Load necessary packages to perform core microbiome, indicator taxa, and ANCOM-BC2 analyses

Seeing as we have already performed analyses using these packages in class, this step differs from the Aim Specific Approach in the Project Proposal, which was to install the packages below.

```{r packages, echo = FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(phyloseq)
library(ggplot2)
library(vegan)
library(ggVennDiagram)
library(microbiome)
library(indicspecies)
library(ANCOMBC)
```

# Load phyloseq and name as object

As the phyloseq object is required for multiple aims, it was first created separately and added to the GitHub repository. This steps loads the phyloseq object and assigns it a name, rather than creating it as outlined in the Project Proposal.

```{r phyloseq}

ps <- readRDS("../phyloseq_taxonomy.rds")
```
