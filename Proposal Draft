### Introduction
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disorder in which the immune system destroys myelin cells. MS manifests in several subtypes, including Relapsing-Remitting MS (RRMS), characterized by episodic relapses and remissions, and Progressive MS (PMS), involving gradual worsening from onset. Depression is a serious mental health disorder, often associated with MS(source), marked by persistent sadness, hopelessness, and cognitive and physical disturbances. Studies have also suggested the gut microbiome, the diverse community of microorganisms in the digestive tract, is deeply connected to both depression and MS, also introducing interesting implications on the gut-brain axis, defined as a bidirectional route connecting the gut microbiome to the brain.

The connection between depression and MS, depression and the gut microbiome and MS and the gut microbiome while considering the gut-brain axis has been researched in the past. Minden et al. (1987) found that depression is significantly more common in MS patients, supporting the idea of a link between MS and depression. Chen, et al., (2022) also states that the composition of the gut microbiome has been found to be different in individuals with depression compared to without depression. Maciak et al. (2022) propose that dysregulation of the gut-brain axis may drive neuroinflammation via activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, thereby suggesting links between gut and neural dysfunction with autoimmunity in MS.

To explore how Multiple Sclerosis initiated changes in the gut microbiome, (source) used 16S RNA to study the global microbial alpha and beta diversity of samples, using the V4 region. Overall, (source) noted an increase in Akkermansia muciniphila, Ruthenibacterium lactatiformans, Hungatella hathewayi and Eisenbergiella tayi populations in patients with MS. Also, they noticed a decrease in Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Blautia species and changes in metabolism for MS patients. Furthermore, (source) indicated there were significant differences in beta diversity scores. These results indicate significant changes in gut microbial diversity due to MS, and more suggest research in this area would be valuable.

Overall, the results of past studies indicate that MS and depression separately have effects on the gut microbiome, as well as a connection to the gut-brain axis. Though extensive research has been done on the relationships between MS and depression, depression and the gut microbiome, and the gut microbiome and MS, research into the effect of both depression and MS severity on microbiome diversity has been limited.

To study this connection further, we hope to build on findings by (source). Our study will aim to analyze gut microbial diversity differences in a total of six controls and experimental groups and compare diversity scores, assessing the effects of MS severity and depression alone on the gut microbiome diversity and composition, but also the effect both have together. We also hope to determine bacterial species specific to each group, with the goal of finding functional differences between microbial communities. Ideally, this study will help bridge the gap between depression, MS severity and the gut microbiome, and provide some insight into the effect of both physical and mental health on the gut microbiome and furthermore the gut-brain axis.

Hypothesis and prediction
How does the presence of depression and the severity of Multiple Sclerosis impact the gut microbial diversity and composition in patients? 

This study aims to explore how and if the presence of depression and the severity of Multiple Sclerosis affect the gut microbiome composition and diversity. We know from previous studies that the effect of depression will cause the diversity of the gut microbiome to decrease. We also know that changes in the gut microbiome due to MS occur, with less severe cases causing a decrease in diversity yet more severe cases causing an increase in diversity. We hypothesize the impact of depression and MS on patients that have both will cause distinct changes in the gut microbiome; RRMS patients with depression will have a significantly decreased gut microbiome diversity while PMS patients with depression will retain diversity similar to the control. Additionally, we hypothesize that there will be different bacterial species in each of our six control and experimental groups due to the effects depression and MS severity have on microbiome composition. 

In the past, it has been determined that the presence of depression can affect the composition of the microbiome. In a study performed by Li et al., the fecal matter of patients with or without depression were analyzed and sequenced. They found that the abundance of certain major species of bacteria in the gut were significantly reduced which suggests that the presence of depression somehow alters the microbiome, reducing diversity. Liu, et al., (2022) found that major depressive disorder led to a significant difference in beta diversity in the composition of beneficial bacteria compared to individuals without depression. Additionally, (source) says at the species level, there was a significant difference in microbial composition of people with depression, with Coprococcus catus being increased and Bacteroides barnesiae being reduced. These findings support the hypothesis that depression will contribute to a decrease in microbiome diversity, and may indicate that in patients with both MS and depression, depression will contribute to a less diverse gut microbiome. Also, these findings indicate that the composition of the gut microbiome will be altered due to depression, suggesting that in patients with MS and depression, depression may contribute to a change in gut microbiome composition. 

Previous studies have identified that certain types of MS are more likely to reduce the diversity of the gut microbiome while others are more likely to increase diversity. Gupta et al., performed a study where they collected fecal samples of MS patients and found that in RRMS, there was a significant decrease in alpha diversity and a significant difference in beta diversity. In a study on PPMS and the gut microbiome by Kozhieva et al., the researchers found that the alpha diversity in participants with PPMS was significantly higher than participants without PPMS. Additionally, Chen et al. (2016) found that patients with MS display a distinct gut-microbiota composition compared to healthy controls, with higher abundances of genera such as Pseudomonas, Mycoplana, Blautia and Dorea, and lower abundances of Parabacteroides, Adlercreutzia, and Prevotella. This supports our hypothesis that patients with RRMS will have significantly less diverse gut microbiomes than the controls, and it is possible that the added aspect of depression in patients with both may decrease diversity further. However those with PMS and depression may have similar diversity values to controls as PMS increases diversity while depression decreases it. Because MS also causes changes in microbiome composition, indicating patients with both depression and MS may have significant gut microbiome changes as both depression and MS alter the expression of certain species, providing support for our hypothesis that gut microbiome composition will be different in each group.

### Experimental Aims and Rationale
#### Aim 1: To determine if the severity of MS and presence of depression together have an effect on the gut microbiome.
Based on previous studies mentioned above, MS severity and depression have different effects on the microbiome diversity and composition. According to (source), RRMS increases diversity of the gut microbiome while PMS reduces diversity. On the other hand, (source) states that, presence of depression decreases diversity of the gut microbiome. Neither study investigated the effect of both depression and MS severity on the diversity of the gut microbiome. By analyzing the gut microbial diversity differences in control and experimental groups, including those who have depression alone, RRMS or PMS alone, or both, this study will provide some insight on this topic.

Aim 1a: processing the data to allow us to perform further down diversity analysis:

We will process our data through qiime first, eliminating problematic reads. We will then transfer our processed data to R using read.tsv and read.delim, where we will make our phyloseq object using Phyloseq R. We will organize our data into the following 6 groups: No Depression No MS, No Depression RRMS, No Depression PMS, Depression No MS, Depression RRMS and Depression PMS.

Aim 1b: Calculating alpha diversity values to find the overall diversity of each of our 6 groups: 

First, we will measure alpha diversity of all groups with a focus on Faith’s Phylogenetic Diversity as it takes richness, evenness and phylogenetic distance into account. We will use the Pictane package in R to complete this analysis. Our goal of determining alpha diversity is to establish microbial diversity within each of the groups. This can be used during further analysis to determine which groups are more diverse than others overall. 

Aim 1c: Calculating beta diversity values to find how different the groups are from one another:

Second, we will perform beta diversity analysis using weighted UniFrac to examine significant differences later on in analysis between groups using the R Phyloseq package. Weighted UniFrac will be used due to its ability to measure abundance as well as phylogenetic distance. Finding beta diversity values will provide some insight into whether groups are made up of similar bacteria or very different bacteria types. 

Aim 1d: Comparing alpha and beta diversity values to determine if there is significance: 

After completing our diversity analyses, we will compare groups to determine if there are any significant differences in alpha and beta diversity values. First we will run a shapiro test to confirm all our groups are non-parametric. Assuming they are non-parametric, we will use kruskal-wallis and PERMANOVA tests to determine significance using built in R packages. We will combine these results with the results from our diversity analysis and display them on a plot using ggplot2. These analyses will provide crucial information regarding diversity differences between groups. 

Furthermore, Aim 1 will allow us to determine if MSSS and presence of depression cause significant changes in gut microbiome diversity both together and separately, providing insight into the research question. 
#### Aim 2: To determine the prevalence of major bacterial species under different conditions (MS or not, depression or not etc.)
Depending on the type of MS a person has, the major bacteria comprising the gut microbiome can differ significantly as some bacteria thrive under the environmental conditions provided by different types of MS. Depression has also been found at specific levels to cause certain bacterial species to become more prominent. While the effects of each condition on prevalence of major bacterial species have been studied independently, the effects of the conditions combined have not been well researched. We hope to determine if specific bacterial species will become more prevalent under the presence of both conditions depending on the type of MS and the presence of depression.

We processed our data through qiime to determine which reads should be removed. We then produce a taxonomy.qza to determine the bacterial species present under each sample. Under R we will take the samples and group them to determine which bacterial species are most prominent under the same conditions. We will then perform a test to see if the difference is significant between conditions (depression and RRMS, depression and PMS etc conditions, no depression PMS, no depression RMS, control without depression, control with depression).
Aim 3: To examine how the gut microbiome function changes with depression and Multiple Sclerosis severity.
After identifying differences in microbial diversity in Aim 1 and major bacterial species in Aim 2, our next goal is to examine how these microbial changes translate into functional differences in the gut microbiome. Understanding the predicted functional capacity of the microbiota can reveal how specific metabolic pathways may influence the progression or severity of MS and the presence of depression.

#### Aim 3a: Perform a functional analysis of the different microbial communities making up our groups: 

To explore these potential functional shifts in control and experiment groups, we will use PICRUSt2 to predict metagenomic functions from 16S and rRNA data obtained in earlier aims. The analysis will allow us to identify metabolic pathways that are enriched or depleted across our defined groups. Functional predictions will be analysed in R using DESeq2, and pathway abundance differences between groups will be assessed statistically. This will help us determine if any of our group's metabolic pathways and functions differ significantly from another group. This builds on our research question; it examines the effects of MSSS and depression on microbiome composition and function by providing insight into functional differences in microbial communities making up groups. 

Aim 3b: Researching most significantly altered pathways: 

Finally, we will perform a literature comparison of the most significantly altered pathways to determine if they have known associations with immune modulation, neuroinflammation, or mood regulation. This aim will help establish potential mechanistic links between microbial functions, MS severity, and depression, providing a broader understanding of how the gut microbiome may influence neuroimmune health. 

Overall, this aim will help investigate the research question further. With Aims 1 and 2, not only would we have determined significant microbial diversity differences between groups, but also specific compositional similarities and differences. Aim 3 helps add meaning to these analyses by investigating functional differences due to microbial composition and their implications towards neuroimmune health and the gut-brain axis.

### Weekly Timeframe


### Dataset Overview
The data used for this analysis was obtained from Gut microbiome of multiple sclerosis patients and paired household healthy controls reveal associations with disease risk and course, published in the Cell Press Journal in 2022. The data obtained includes the samples and metadata of 924 participants, which was then denoised using the Deblur tool in QIIME2.

Figure 1: PHRED score for each base before denoising.

To determine the metrics for truncating the data when denoising, we first looked at the plot of the data’s PHRED scores, as shown in Figure 1. Upon seeing that each nucleotide had a median PHRED score above thirty, which indicates high quality, we chose to keep all the base pairs. With Deblur, we truncated the data at 151 neucleotides (nts), which was the maximum length. The Deblur tool automatically excludes reads that are less than the selected nts length, which removed the few samples that had fewer than 151 nucleotides.
